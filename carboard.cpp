/*
I have decided to take an incremental development approach.I have decided to take an sequential	development approach in creating my program.
I have started off by printing the basic empty board and then followed it by displaying one of the two provided boards to work with.
I then worked on developing a way to put a player on the selected map with a set coordinate and direction.
I incrementally added a feature to my program and tested each feature out with input validations and tested their functionality.
This sequencial approach helped me build my program in a more sequential manner so when using multiple intertwined files, it is easier.
The first issue that I faced was trying to get one of the boards to display. I was able to print out the board but couldnâ€™t save it to have a player positioned on it.
I was a bit confused with the concept of when to use pass by reference and pass by values. I then struggled with a few input validations where the whole line needed to be read in several pieces.
I was also not able to stop my program from displaying an unused map when the user wanted to set the starting position of the arrow.
